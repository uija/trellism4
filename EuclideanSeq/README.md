# Euclidean Sequencer

This is my attempt to use euclidean patterns to generate music.

Currently we have 6 tracks with individual settings

- Channel #1 sends a fixed E3 on MIDI Channel 1
- Channel #2 sends a fixed E3 on MIDI Channel 2 
- Channel #3 sends a fixed E3 on MIDI Channel 3
- I use the first 3 channels for drums
- Channel #4 sends the root note of the progression on MIDI Channel 4
- Channel #5 sends an Arp over 8 notes based on the triad of progression on MIDI Channel 5
- Channel #6 sends the triad of the progression on MIDI Channel 6
